### Hi, I'm Velizar Ivanov

- Software developer with several years of experience
- I'm mainly a backend dev with experience using Node.js, Go and Ruby
- Recently I've found an interest with frontend technologies like Angular(2+) and React (always TypeScript)
- When I have time I usually try to learn some new technology
- Learning more about full stack development

### Projects:
Some of the personal projects that I have worked on. The main goal for most of them was to get used with some technology:

- [Vinteres](https://github.com/vinteres) - Angular 10, Node.js, Postgres, AWS (S3 & Recognition)
- [Simple chat app](https://github.com/no0n3/chat-app) - React + TypeScript, Go, Postgres
- [Twoter](https://github.com/twoter) - Angular 5, Java + Spring, Postgres
